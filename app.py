This prediction model uses machine learning to forecast the final first innings score in an IPL match based on:
- Current batting and bowling teams
- Runs scored and wickets fallen
- Recent performance (last 5 overs)
- Historical match data from previous IPL seasons

The model was trained on data from IPL seasons 2008-2016 and tested on seasons 2017-2019.
